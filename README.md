Introduction:

The goal of the project is to upload a user-identified file which includes multiple lines of words only.  After the file is read, 
each line is to be split into a list of words.  Then, a list should be made which is comprised of the distinct words that exist within
the file.  So, if a word is shown more than once within the txt file, it is included only once within the final list.  The final list
should display all of the distinct words in alphabetical order.

Data:

The data is provided in the form of a txt file.  All of the data are strings, english words that are written in a paragraph.

Source:

The project is a part of the Python Data Structures course via Coursera.org.  The assignment outlined is exactly as it is given through
the course.
